# BiographiesSofteng
A repository holding the biographies of influential software engineers and project.
The biography/report is written by me.
Might hold multiple if i don't feel confident on the first one I make.
# I ABSOLUTELY have no intention of making a biography on a software engineer that I don't find inspiring or interesting. I spent some time looking for one, but despite how interesting their accomplishments may be from an objective perspective I didn't find it inspiring from a personal standpoint so I didn't make one.
